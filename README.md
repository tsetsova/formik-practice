# Practice app to learn more about formik, tailwind, react forms etc

## Todo:

- [x] add a basic form
- [x] connect it to requestbin
- [x] switch to using json-server and a local db file
- [x] add component tests
- [x] add validation
- [x] make react-flash-message myself
- [x] test the flash messages
- [x] test validation
- [x] add another field to make the form more complex
- [x] switch to using formik
- [x] disable button when loading
- [x] show confirmation if form submit was succesful and error if failed
- [x] switch to using yup for validation
- [x] switch to using a nested object
- [ ] test FormikBag

## Other ideas
- expolore react-router
- explore react-query
- once the form gets more complicated, create a basic Rails api, where the pokemon decision logic is calculated. The front end will send the user response to the api and the api will return the pokemon back
- save user responses in postgres
- switch to using graphql between react and rails
- expolore apollo 
- add typescript
