# Practice app to learn more about formik, tailwind, react forms etc

## Todo:

- [x] add a basic form
- [x] connect it to requestbin
- [ ] switch to using json-server and a local db file
- [ ] add component tests
- [ ] add validation
- [ ] switch to using formik
- [ ] switch to using yup for validation

## Other ideas

- once the form gets more complicated, create a basic Rails api, where the pokemon decision logic is calculated. The front end will send the user response to the api and the api will return the pokemon back
- save user responses in postgres
- switch to using graphql between react and rails
- add typescript
